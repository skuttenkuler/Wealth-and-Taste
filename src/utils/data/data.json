He is an absolute killer with black and grey, but his bright and bold contrasted pallets make it clear that color is his true calling card. Sweets excels in large scale projects. If you’re looking for a sleeve, front torso, or full back piece, he is the artist for you. That said, neck, hand and head tattoos are always fun! \n To book with Sweets email him at sweetstattoo@yahoo.com",
